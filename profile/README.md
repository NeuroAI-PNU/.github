## Hi there üëã

Here‚Äôs a guide to help you get started with our GitHub repository:

üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Introduction**

Welcome to the NeuroAI Lab‚Äôs repository! We conduct innovative research at the intersection of neuroscience and medical artificial intelligence, focusing on multi-scale levels of analysis. Our key research areas include:

1. **In Silico Drug Discovery**: We utilize advanced AI models, such as Graph Neural Networks and Transformers, alongside molecular dynamics simulations, to conduct research on drug discovery in silico.
2. **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms with Biological Constraints**: Our work explores reinforcement learning algorithms incorporating biologically-inspired constraints, including hippocampal place cell models and their anatomical and physiological characteristics. We develop computational models to understand various phenomena in neuroscience, investigate neuropsychiatric disorders, and study the role of neuromodulators.
3. **Biomedical Data Analysis with Cutting-edge AI**: We apply state-of-the-art AI technologies, including machine learning, large language models, and explainable AI, to biomedical data for diagnostic and prognostic research.

üëÄ **Contribution Guidelines**

We value collaboration and welcome contributions from both internal team members and external collaborators! Here‚Äôs how you can get involved:

- **For External Collaborators:**
  1. **Fork the repository** to your own GitHub account.
  2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-fork-url.git
     ```
  3. **Create a new branch** for your work:
     ```bash
     git checkout -b your-feature-branch
     ```
  4. **Make your changes** and provide thorough documentation.
  5. **Push your changes** to your fork:
     ```bash
     git push origin your-feature-branch
     ```
  6. **Submit a Pull Request (PR)** from your fork to the main repository with a clear explanation of your contributions.
